This utility tries to make it easier for delegators to estiamte weekly,
monthly and yearly yields from staking their LPT tokens in one of the active
orchestrators on the livepeer network.

As a secondary goal, this utility also tries to demonstrate the concept of an
orchestrators theoretical limit, indicating which orchestrators are overstaked
and which are understaked given the delegator the chance to maximize their yield
when delegating.

Finally, this tool can also be usefully for new ochestrator operators to estimate
how much LPT and ETH they can earn from running an orchestrator.

This project was funded with a livepeer grant. You can check out the grant proposal
[here](https://github.com/livepeer/Grant-Program/issues/25) 

Almost all of the calculations done in this project are based on the [livepeer orchestrator
bussiness model] (https://forum.livepeer.org/t/livepeer-orchestrator-business-model-updates-and-grant-progress/1083)
propsed and developed by the chainflow team.
